Currently working on Karsten, a personal finance accounting software!
The inspiration came by desiring features that GnuCash lacks / implements poorly in my opinion.  
Gnucash is a personal/small business finance application and works fine for most simple uses cases.  
However, features like entering cross currency transactions (eg HKD to SGD) are complicated/bugged, and entering investment purchases are a pain too.  
So I started Karsten to create a GnuCash mostly lookalike with my personal take.  
*In Development, socket programming, Qt and C++ proving much harder than anticipated :persevere: *
