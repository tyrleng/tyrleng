Currently working on Karsten, a personal finance accounting software!  

I curently rely Gnucash to keep track of my personal finances. However, Gnucash lacks some features / implements them poorly in my opinion.  
Features like entering cross currency transactions (eg HKD to SGD) are complicated/bugged, and entering investment purchases are a pain too.  
So I started Karsten to create a GnuCash mostly lookalike with my personal take on the features I find wanting!  

*Currently In Development. Socket programming, Qt and C++ proving much harder than anticipated :persevere:*
