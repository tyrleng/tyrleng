Working on Karsten, a personal finance accounting software as my eventual replacement for GnuCash, a personal finance accounting program.  

I use GnuCash extensively, but I think lacks some features / implements them poorly, which cripples me in having an accurate representation of my finances.  
Features like entering cross currency transactions (eg HKD to SGD) are complicated/bugged, and entering investment purchases are a pain too.  
So I started Karsten to create a GnuCash mostly lookalike with my personal take on the features I find wanting.  

*Currently In Development. Using Socket programming, Qt and C++ in combination is proving much harder than anticipated :persevere:*
